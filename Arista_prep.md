Here's a **2-day plan** to prepare for your **Arista Networks Technical Round 2** based on their expectations and your experience level (9+ years):  

---

#Day 1: System Design & Problem Solving**
#### **Morning (3-4 hours)**
✅ **Review High-Level Design & Architecture (Projects)**  
- List the major projects you've worked on.  
- Identify components, interfaces, state machines, control & data flows.  
- Prepare a concise explanation of one complex project, covering:  
  - **Architecture**: How components interact.  
  - **State Machines**: Event handling, transitions.  
  - **Data Flow**: Movement of data, bottlenecks, optimizations.  

✅ **Practice a Design Problem (DNS Lookup Cache)**  
- Understand problem constraints.  
- Think of multiple approaches (**Hashed linked list, Trie, Balanced Trees**).  
- Discuss **time complexity, pros & cons** of each approach.  
- Design for **Concurrency** (mutex, lock-free DS, reader-writer locks).  
- Write pseudo-code in C for one approach.  
- Think of edge cases and test cases.  

---

#### **Afternoon (3-4 hours)**
✅ **DS & Algo Focus**  
- Revise **Linked Lists, Trees, Hashing, Tries, Priority Queues.**  
- Solve 2-3 **Medium-to-Hard Leetcode problems** on:  
  - **Graph traversal (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s).**  
  - **Cache implementation (LRU, LFU, TTL-based caching).**  
  - **Concurrency problems (Producer-Consumer, Readers-Writers).**  

✅ **Coding Practice (Avoid STL maps, use arrays/structs in C)**  
- Implement a **custom Hash Table** (without STL).  
- Implement a **Trie-based search system.**  

---

### **Day 2: OS, Debugging & Linux Tools**
#### **Morning (3-4 hours)**
✅ **C Program Memory Layout**  
- Review **stack, heap, text, BSS, and data segments.**  
- Understand **malloc/free, memory fragmentation, stack overflows.**  

✅ **OS Memory Management & Process Concepts**  
- Review **paging, demand paging, TLB, page replacement algorithms.**  
- Understand **threads vs. processes, context switching, IPC mechanisms.**  
- Synchronization techniques (mutex, semaphore, spinlocks, RW locks).  

✅ **Concurrency & Multi-threading Practice**  
- Implement a **multi-threaded cache system** with a read-write lock.  

---

#### **Afternoon (3-4 hours)**
✅ **Linux Debugging Tools & Performance Analysis**  
- **Memory Issues Debugging**:  
  - `valgrind`, `gdb`, `asan` (AddressSanitizer) for memory leaks.  
- **Process Crash Debugging**:  
  - `gdb corefile`, `strace`, `lsof`, `pmap`.  
- **Kernel Debugging (if relevant)**:  
  - Debugging kernel panics using `dmesg`, `crash` utility.  
- **Packet Analysis** (Must-Have for Arista!):  
  - `tcpdump`, `wireshark` for network troubleshooting.  

✅ **Final Mock Coding Round**  
- Solve **one system design problem** (e.g., rate limiter, message queue).  
- Solve **one OS/threading problem** (e.g., bounded buffer, mutex handling).  
- Implement **a debugging scenario** using `gdb`/`tcpdump`.

### **Extra Tips:**
✔ **Write Code in C** (avoid high-level abstractions like STL).  
✔ **Use Whiteboard/Notebook** for system design discussions.  
✔ **Prepare Real-World Scenarios** from your past projects.  
✔ **Think About Edge Cases & Performance Trade-offs.**  

Would you like me to prepare sample questions for system design or OS debugging?
