### Introduction ###
- Hi, I’m currently working as a Principal Development Engineer at Calsoft, where I’ve been for the past 3 years, primarily in the storage and networking domain.
- My day-to-day work involves C, C++, and Python on Linux, and I’ve contributed to projects like developing Redfish-compliant APIs for server management and control plane development for SONiC, the open-source networking OS.

- Before that, I was with Dassault Systèmes for almost 3 years, working on PLM solutions — specifically customizing CATIA v6 for Naval Group. I handled both feature development and performance improvements using C++ on Windows, and even got to implement a cache mechanism that boosted performance by around 20%.

- I started my career at NCR Corporation, where I worked in the retail domain — building POS and system imaging utilities. That’s where I got my foundation in product development, software packaging, and client interactions.	

- Across all roles, I’ve been hands-on with low-level system programming, performance tuning, and cross-platform development, and I’m passionate about solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code.


### Why you want to change ###
- Over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects across different domains. 
- While this has certainly broadened my skill set, the frequent changes have made it challenging to gain deep product knowledge or see the long-term impact of my contributions.
- I’m now looking for a more stable environment where I can focus on a product or domain for a longer period, take ownership of critical components, and grow both technically and strategically.
- I believe your organization offers that kind of stability and technical depth.
