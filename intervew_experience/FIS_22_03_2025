Round 1
Is it possible to use smart pointers on socket or FILE pointers? - Yes with additonal deleters
Is it possible to create class object using malloc?
  - Yes, however malloc only allocates the memory and can not call to destructor.
  - while new will create the memory + call the constructor to construct the object. 
Create a class having state() function which continuesly prints the logs. 
   - You need to start the thread when constructor get's called from main and thread should stop in destructor
IF we use map with key as an class object type, what changes you need to make to work? - comparator operator overload
Is same with unordered_map()?
Vector default capacity = 1 but why?
deque internal implementation
What is disadvantage of vector and who overcomes it?
vector vs dequeue


Round 2
1. Create a class with character pointer, create one object using new. another create another object using void pointer. 
2. Rules of type casting in C++
3. clipboard example, how to implement 

Round 3
1. What is your rolese and responsibilities as dev lead handson?
