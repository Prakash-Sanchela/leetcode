Find sub string
Why there's no find() function in vector
	Find needs to compare, to compare class needs to have comparator. 
	So ideally with respect to vector, searching complexity is O(1) using indexing, still if you want to search user has to iterate over the vector and compare one by one. 
	Find won't work with vector is because type of vector can't have comparator operator overloaded.
