	1. Linked list :Let's say you have billions of single link list and you will not get head of the list.
	As we have billions of node we don't want to traverse complete list to delete the single node. 
	Instead you'll be given address of that node which needs to be deleted. How will you delete
	2. Bit manipulation : Swap bits of 32 bit integer. 
	E.g. Input(int num, int starting_bit, int starting_bit_to_swap, int number of bits to swap)
	Input :48, 2,5,2 : bit 2-3 needs to be swapped with bit 5-6. 
	ip-0011 0000
	
	op-0001 0100
	3. Bit manipulation : Reset the perticular bit position on number
	5- 0000 0101 reset the first bit
	4. Remove duplicates from the string
	5. Linked list : Remove nth node from the end
	6. Storage classes in C
	7. Memory organization in C
	8. Global vs static
	9. How to know the chrome traffic is using quic protocol or not
	10. Why quic is faster then tcp/udp. How chrome decides should I use quic or not?
	11. How MPTCP works?
	12. Networking : Two systems connected to switch A<->switch<->B. 
	If A wants to send data to B what is the process. 
	Does IP involved here? If yes switch works on L3 how does it involved IP
