Write a 10 line code
Copy constroctor and assignmenet operator
if both code are same then we are violating the oops pronciple of not to reuse the code.
Why did you used raw pointer where you can use std::string and arrays
Check operations or write a comlete class with string 
class Pune
{
  private:
    int counter;
  public:
    void update_counter()
    {
      count++
    }
};

from main, call update_counter using thread;

Insert the 10 element in vector, now remove the even element from vector
why the size of empty class is one byte?
